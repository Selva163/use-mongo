Mongo References

This repository is a reference to some more than basic mongo queries other than hello world. And this is a growing repository meaning 

I'll be using two datasets 'Companies' and 'Stocks'. I found the datasets here https://github.com/ozlerhakan/mongodb-json-files. Feel free to try on your own.

And the notebooks are in no proper order except that queries are organized according to the function they perform. But the first notebook you should be checking is "First things First!!!" . Let's use mongo.
